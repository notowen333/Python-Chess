# Python-Chess
Chess built out in python to be played on the terminal. Eventually a chess AI will be added.

This Chess game uses long-form algebraic chess notation (So you say e2-e4, instead of e4, or you say Kb1xc3 to
say knight takes on c3). 

Right now, it's missing en-passant, pawn promtion, and stalemate by repitition. 

The structure of the code is Object Oriented. The board is re-rendered after each move to show all of the pieces
which remain.

To show the background of the board, I use the colorama python library, and I use unicode characters to display
the pieces.
